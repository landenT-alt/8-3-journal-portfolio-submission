Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The requirements of the app i create was to create and app that had a database for loggin weights that people could track. I need to create a login screen as well as a home screen and a database screen. My personal goals for this app was to create an app that anyone could use wether you wanted to gain or lose weight and make it simple and easy to use. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

I needed a login screen as well as a home screen where the user was able to log there weight. I kept the UI simple for the user. I think my designs were succesful because they were simple but gave the app a unique look. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I approached my coding for the app with a pass and fail technique. I would make adjustments to the code and UI and then test and change things as I went. I think this is my favorite way to go about coding as it teaches as you go and you always know where you code stands. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I ran the code every chance I got to make sure it was functional and to test the UI designs. I think this was very important because I alwasy felt confident about my code. 

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I had to innovate with some of the code. I am not as knowledgable as I want to be with my code and some of it was a challenge trying to figure out what to use. 

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I think my login screen demonstrates my skills best. I like the way the desing looks and everything is functional.
